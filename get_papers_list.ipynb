      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText>Cardiology, a high-acuity medical specialty, has traditionally emphasised technical expertise, often overshadowing the critical role of non-technical skills (NTS). This imbalance stems from the historical focus on procedural competence and clinical knowledge in cardiology training and practice, leaving a significant gap in the development of crucial interpersonal and cognitive abilities. However, emerging evidence highlights the significant impact of NTS on patient outcomes, team dynamics, and overall healthcare efficiency. This review explores the importance of NTS in cardiology whilst drawing parallels with other high-stakes fields, such as aviation, surgery, and emergency medicine, which have successfully integrated NTS frameworks. These fields are particularly relevant due to their similar requirements for rapid decision-making under pressure, team-based approaches, and the potential for severe consequences in case of errors. Key NTS domains relevant to cardiology include leadership, such as in guiding cardiac teams effectively during procedures and emergencies; cooperation and resource management, such as focusing on optimising team performance and resource allocation in cardiac care units; communication and interaction, such as clear and concise information exchange during complex cardiac interventions; assessment and decision-making such as making critical choices in time-sensitive situations; situational awareness (SA) that maintains a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition and surrounding environment; and coping with stress, which involves managing personal and team stress during and after high-pressure situations. The integration of NTS into cardiology practice is essential for improving patient care, reducing healthcare costs, and preventing clinician burnout. Despite the recognition of NTS' importance, there is a notable lack of structured training and validated assessment tools in cardiology. This absence poses a significant challenge to the implementation of NTS, as it hinders the systematic development and evaluation of these crucial skills amongst cardiologists. For instance, whilst technical skills in procedures like angiography are rigorously assessed, there is limited formal evaluation of NTS, for instance, a cardiologist's ability to lead a team effectively during a cardiac emergency. This review advocates for the development and implementation of NTS training and evaluation methods suitable for cardiology, emphasising the need for a balanced skill set that complements technical proficiency with social and cognitive abilities. Future research should focus on adapting existing tools or developing new ones to address the unique challenges of cardiology teams and foster safer, more effective patient care. Specific areas for investigation include developing cardiology-specific NTS assessment tools, creating structured NTS training programmes for cardiology fellows, evaluating the impact of NTS training on patient outcomes in cardiac care, and exploring the relationship between NTS proficiency and technical skill performance in cardiology procedures. By addressing these research gaps and developing targeted NTS interventions, cardiology can foster a more comprehensive approach to professional development, ultimately leading to improved patient care and healthcare efficiency in this critical field.</AbstractText>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText>This report presents the case of a 66-year-old man with acute torrential aortic insufficiency after a Ross procedure 20 years earlier, a biologic aortic valve replacement 16 years earlier, and a transcatheter valve-in-valve 4 years earlier. He underwent third-time sternotomy, revealing that the pulmonary autograft was heavily calcified and frozen to the homograft. The previous transcatheter valve-in-valve was explanted. The previous bioprosthetic valve was adhered in place, necessitating emergency deployment of a replacement transcatheter valve-in-valve. The patient recovered well, with normal aortic valve function. Techniques from cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology are rapidly converging in invasiveness, thus making hybrid strategies increasingly important in complex cases.</AbstractText>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"BACKGROUND\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Single-ventricle cardiac defects (SVCDs) are among of the most health care resource-intensive congenital diseases. Although SVCDs are traditionally palliated using the Norwood pathway, in the last 2 decades select programs have used the hybrid strategy, which redistributes the operative and interstage risks. This study sought to characterize resource use for a cohort of patients with hybrid-palliated SVCD.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">All patients with SVCDs who underwent palliation with the hybrid strategy and who were followed up exclusively at our institution from January 2008 to December 2021 were included. End points were death, Norwood conversion, orthotopic heart transplantation, 6 months post-Fontan status, or 4 years of age in those patients who had not completed staged palliation. Primary end points included total days hospitalized, number of cardiology visits, echocardiograms, catheterizations, and advanced imaging performed.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Of 135 patients with a diagnosis of SVCD, 72 survived for 6 months after the Fontan procedure. By patient-year for the entirety of the pathway, patients had a median hospital length of stay of 16 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12-25 days), 7 cardiology visits (IQR, 6-9), 8 echocardiograms (IQR, 7-10), and 0.7 catheterizations (IQR, 0.4-1.1). The interstage 1 period had the heaviest resource burden requiring intense cardiology follow-up and echocardiography surveillance. Cardiac catheterizations and advanced imaging were most prevalent during interstage 2 period, with a median of 2 (IQR, 1-2) catheterizations and 36 (40%) patients undergoing advanced imaging. The total median number of hospital days per patient was 63 days (IQR, 47-98.5 days).</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Resource use for the care of patients with SVCDs is significant. The intensity of surveillance decreases as patients progress through the pathway. In comparison with published Norwood pathway data, resource intensity and use patterns in hybrid palliation are comparable.</AbstractText>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"BACKGROUND\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is frequently performed in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and may aid non-invasive estimation of pulmonary hemodynamics. We, therefore, investigated automated volumetry of intrapulmonary vasculature on CTPA, separated into core and peel fractions of the lung volume and its potential to differentially reflect pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with pre- and postcapillary PH.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">A retrospective case-control study of 72 consecutive patients with PH according to the 2022 joint guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society who underwent right heart catheterization (RHC) and CTPA within 7 days between August 2013 and February 2016 at Thoraxklinik at Heidelberg University Hospital (Heidelberg, Germany) was conducted. Vessel segmentation was performed using the in-house software YACTA. Vascular volumes in different core and peel fractions of the lung were corrected for body surface area. Spearman correlation coefficients with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were calculated, and a linear regression analysis was done to account for potential confounders.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Median age of the study sample was 71.5 years [interquartile range (IQR), 60.0-77.0 years], 48 (66.67%) were female. Median mPAP was 35.5 mmHg (IQR, 27.0-47.2 mmHg). Postcapillary PH was present in 24/72 (33.3%) patients and precapillary PH in 48/72 (66.7%) patients. Moderate to strong correlations between core intrapulmonary vessel volumes and mPAP were observed in postcapillary PH patients with a maximum at 50% core lung volume (r=0.71, P&lt;0.001). No significant influence of age or sex on this relationship was identified. Correlation with RHC measurements was weak or negligible in patients with precapillary PH.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Automated volumetry of vessels in the core lung strongly correlated with mPAP in patients with postcapillary PH and has potential for non-invasive assessment of postcapillary PH in patients undergoing CTPA.</AbstractText>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of premature death in the UK. Lipid testing is a key tool used to assess cardiovascular risk and guide clinical management decisions. There are currently no national guidelines to provide evidence-based recommendations on lipid testing and reporting for UK laboratories and clinicians. Here we present consensus guidance, following a review of published evidence by a multidisciplinary group of UK experts across a range of laboratory and clinical services. Recommendations include: the composition of a standard lipid profile; indications for, and composition of, an enhanced lipid profile including apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a); use of the Sampson-NIH calculation for LDL-c estimation; and guidance on when to flag abnormal results. This consensus guidance on lipid testing and reporting in the UK has been endorsed by HEART UK and The Association for Laboratory Medicine.</AbstractText>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. It is estimated that 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, which represents 32 % of all deaths worldwide. Cardiovascular drugs are the most common medical intervention for the prevention of cardiovascular events. CV medications have many benefits however their application is often complicated by multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can lead to adverse drug events, hospitalizations, prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and increased risk of mortality. Hospital admission provides an opportunity for pharmacotherapy analysis and for identifying DDIs which can jeopardize medication safety. The aim of this study is to determine the type and prevalence of potential clinically significant DDIs in patients with CVD and to examine factors associated with exposure to DDIs. A prospective study was conducted at the Dubrava University Hospital at the Clinic of Cardiology during a 6-month period (September 2023 - February 2024). Demographic, clinical and pharmacotherapy data were collected for each patient. The first prescribed pharmacotherapy was analyzed. The research was approved by the Hospital's Ethics Committee and each patient involved in the study signed an informed consent. Lexicomp\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t<sup>®</sup>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t Lexi-InteractTM Online (Lexi-Comp, Inc., USA) was used for DDI analysis. Poisson regression was used for regression analysis for determining risk factors associated with exposure to DDIs. Total of 151 patients admitted to Cardiology ward were included in the research, and the average age was 67 years. Patients had an average of 9 medications in their therapy and 8 diagnoses. Overall, 1268 potential clinically significant DDIs were determined, of which the most frequently determined interactions were grade C (90.9 %), then grade D (8.6 %) and grade X (0.6 %). CV medications were involved in 88 % DDIs. The most common interventions regarding identified DDIs included exclusion one of the drugs, dose adjustment, increased monitoring of signs of bleeding, cardiac disorders, hypoglycemia, CNS depression and rhabdomyolysis, blood pressure, markers of renal function and electrolyte status. Factors associated with the prevalence of potential clinically significant DDIs were decreased renal function, recent hospitalization, total number of comorbidities and polypharmacy. Specific comorbidities associated with DDIs were arrhythmia, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and disease of the respiratory system. A high prevalence of DDIs of CV medications in all categories of clinical significance was determined. Managing medication safety in specific patient groups with CVDs can represent a greater challenge regarding DDIs. Certain medical conditions, such as arrhythmia, heart failure, diabetes, and diseases of the respiratory system, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, impaired renal function and recent hospitalization are identified in this research as additional factors associated with DDIs occurrence in patients with CVDs at hospital admission. Hospital admission is one of the crucial points for managing medication safety. Clinical pharmacists should regularly analyze DDIs in prescribed pharmaco-therapy which enhances medication safety and also contributes to the quality of provided health care.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText>The hERG1 potassium channel conducts the cardiac repolarizing current, IKr. hERG1 has emerged as a therapeutic target for cardiac diseases marked by prolonged actional potential duration (APD). Unfortunately, many hERG1 activators display off-target and proarrhythmic effects that limit their therapeutic potential. A Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain in the hERG1 N-terminus reduces IKr by slowing channel activation and promoting inactivation. Disrupting PAS activity increases IKr and shortens APD in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We thus hypothesized that the hERG1 PAS domain could represent a therapeutic target to reduce arrhythmogenic potential in a long QT syndrome (LQTS) background. To test this, we measured the antiarrhythmic capacity of a PAS-disabling single-chain variable fragment antibody, scFv2.10, in a hiPSC-CM line derived from a Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLN) patient. JLN is a severe form of LQTS caused by autosomal recessive mutations in KCNQ1. The patient in this study carried compound heterozygous mutations in KCNQ1. Corresponding JLN hiPSC-CMs displayed prolonged APD and early after depolarizations (EADs). Disrupting PAS with scFv2.10 increased IKr, shortened APD, and reduced the incidence of EADs. These data demonstrate that the hERG1 PAS domain could serve as a therapeutic target to treat disorders of cardiac electrical dysfunction.</AbstractText>\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"BACKGROUND\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">It is now widely acknowledged that diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures largely affect an individual's metabolic state in health and disease, including the brain. Metabolomics has demonstrated its potential to enable exciting discoveries in brain health, facilitated by advances in analytical and informatics techniques. Here, we highlighted the use of MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics to study the diet and medication exposure of cognitively declined cohorts through the newly developed FoodMASST and DrugMASST tools.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">A food metabolomics reference dataset was created with tandem mass spectrometry data (MS/MS) alongwith detailed and structured metadata for ∼3,500 foods. We used this resource to trace the food origin of important Alzheimer's disease metabolite biomarkers as well as to investigate the empirical diet patterns of subjects in a Mediterranean diet intervention study (MIND). An MS/MS spectral library for drugs, metabolites, and related molecules was developed by spectral similarity search against ∼1.2 billion public metabolomics spectra. We utilized this resource to perform empirical medication read-out in 501 brain samples from the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) and 637 fecal samples from the Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs).</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">We demonstrated the utility of the FoodMASST and DrugMASST tools through several examples. Using FoodMASST we demonstrated that lentil is an important food source of tryptophan betaine, an important AD marker. FoodMASST-based diet score separated the metabolomics profiles of MIND subjects in the PCoA cohort. DrugMASST detected 102 drugs in brain samples from the ROS/MAP and revealed that neurology/psychiatry and cardiology drugs were the most important categories. The computationally derived drug metabolite library enabled additional annotation of 15 drug metabolites with high confidence. We observed significant separation in the metabolome of patients with and without antibiotic detection. In the ADRC fecal samples, we detected 190 drugs and the neurology/psychiatry and cardiology categories had the highest number of drugs observed. Carbidopa, a dopamine promoter drug given to treat PD, was detected in 62% of the patients.</AbstractText>\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t<AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Untargeted metabolomics tools, such as metadata-driven metabolomics exemplified by FoodMASST and DrugMASST, create insights into patients' chemical exposure and their role in gut microbiome and Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText>\n",
